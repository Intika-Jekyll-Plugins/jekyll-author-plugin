# Jekyll Author Plugin
We had a simple custom requirement while using Jekyll for our old website
@multunus. We wanted to group blog posts by author name. Hence, we came up with
this quick small plugin for Jekyll.

## Features
- Create a listing page for "posts by author".
- Adds a link to the author for listing
- Now it supports Octopress!

## Usage
- Clone the repository
- Copy the author_generator.rb file to the plugins directory
- Copy the files under _includes to the _includes directory
- Copy the files under _layouts directory to the _layouts directory
- To customize the look and feel, change the author_index.html in the _layouts directory.
